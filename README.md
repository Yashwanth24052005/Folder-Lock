# Folder Lock: Secure Your Data with Encryption and 2FA

## 📌 Overview
Folder Lock is a security-driven application designed to protect sensitive files and folders with advanced encryption and two-factor authentication (2FA). This ensures that only authorized users can access protected data, enhancing overall cybersecurity.

## 🔒 Features
- **🔐 Folder Encryption** – Secure your files and folders using AES encryption.
- **🔑 Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** – Adds an extra layer of protection.
- **👤 User Authentication** – Login system with password protection.
- **🖥️ Intuitive GUI** – Easy-to-use graphical interface built with Tkinter.
- **🛠️ Cross-Platform Compatibility** – Supports Windows and Linux.
- **📜 Logging & Monitoring** – Tracks access attempts for security audits.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** – Core Programming Language
- **Tkinter** – Graphical User Interface
- **Cryptography** – AES Encryption (via `cryptography` library)
- **PyOTP** – One-Time Password (OTP) for 2FA
- **SQLite** – Secure database for credentials and logs

## 📥 Installation
